# Portfolio

## Description

I want potential employers to be able to view my deployed portfolio of work samples so that they can review and assess whether I'm a good candidate for an open position. This project serves as a educational tool early on in my coding journey to becoming a creative app developer. It enforces basic knowledge of HTML/CSS, markdown, git, github and fundamental practices for deploying a website. With it's deployment, I've officially released my first website and learned a number of skills including:

- semantic HTML elements
- sticky navbar and hover effects
- layout with flexbox and grid
- element positioning
- creating a README with markdown language
- responsive layouts for multiple viewports
- linking to sections and different pages
- beautiful CSS implementation for blockquotes
- deploying apps and pushing from git bash to github
- and built low-level apps utilizing javascript HTML DOM
